# appdoo - SimpleWebBrowser

This example app shows how to create a very simple browser with the element "Web View" and three buttons. The start URL of the Web View is defined in the app itself. Using the buttons you can go back and forward and reload the current page.

Of course, this is only a small part of the appdoo functionality. More information can be found on the [website](https://www.mamp.info/appdoo/en/){:target="blank"} and in the [documentation](http://documentation.mamp.info/appdoo/en/Mac/){:target="_blank"}.
